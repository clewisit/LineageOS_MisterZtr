### To get started with building the unofficial LineageOS 23.2 GSI together with the patches,
You'll need to get familiar with [Git and Repo](https://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html) as well as [How to build a GSI](https://github.com/phhusson/treble_experimentations/wiki/How-to-build-a-GSI%3F).

### Create the directories

As a first step, you'll have to create and enter a folder with the appropriate name
To do that, run these commands:

```bash
mkdir lineage-23.2-misterztr
cd lineage-23.2-misterztr
```

### To initialize your local repository, run this command:

```bash
repo init -u https://github.com/LineageOS/android.git -b lineage-23.2 --git-lfs
```

### Clone the Manifest to add necessary dependencies for gsi:
 
    git clone https://github.com/clewisit/treble_manifest_misterztr.git .repo/local_manifests -b lineage-23.2
  
### Afterwards, sync the source by running this command:

```bash
repo sync --force-sync --optimized-fetch --no-tags --no-clone-bundle --prune -j4
```

### Next, apply patches:


```
bash LineageOS_gsi/patches/apply-patches.sh .
```

### Building treble_app

treble_app is now used from your compiled version.  
First, make sure that Java 17 is set as your default. How to do this on [Arch Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Java#List_compatible_Java_environments_installed)  
The compilation itself,

### Use ccache to speed up Android rebuilds

You can add these lines to the ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc file to avoid typing them again:

```
export USE_CCACHE=1
export CCACHE_COMPRESS=1
export CCACHE_MAXSIZE=50G # 50 GB
ccache -M 50G -F 0
``` 

### Building Android with ext4:

VANILLA version with ext4:

 ```
. build/envsetup.sh
breakfast lineage_arm64_bvN4-bp4a-userdebug
make systemimage -j$(nproc --all)
 ```
 
GAPPS version with ext4:

 ```
. build/envsetup.sh
breakfast lineage_arm64_bgN4-bp4a-userdebug
make systemimage -j$(nproc --all)
 ```
 
### Building Android with ext4:

VANILLA version with erofs:

 ```
. build/envsetup.sh
breakfast lineage_arm64_bvNE-bp4a-userdebug
make systemimage -j$(nproc --all)
 ```
 
GAPPS version with erofs:

 ```
. build/envsetup.sh
breakfast lineage_arm64_bgNE-bp4a-userdebug
make systemimage -j$(nproc --all)
 ```

### Sign targets

 ```
make -j$(lscpu -b -p=Core,Socket | grep -v '^#' | sort -u | wc -l) target-files-package otatools
bash ./lineage_build_unified/sign_target_files.sh $OUT/signed_target_files.zip
unzip -joq $OUT/signed_target_files.zip IMAGES/system.img -d $OUT/signed
 ```

### Compress

After compilation,
If you want to compress the build, i recommend use [7-zip](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/7-zip), for a fast and safe way
In rom folder,

   ```
cd out/target/product/tdgsi_arm64_ab
7z a system.img.xz "system.img"
   ```

### Troubleshoot
 
If you face any conflicts while applying patches, apply the patch manually
